# School_District_Analysis
Mod 04 Python Jupyter Notebook Pandas

## PyCity Schools

1.  Test scores in reading and math were looked at for high schoolers in this district after removing suspected cheating by 9th graders at Thomas High      School, replicating some of the work in the module.
2.  Scores were calculated on an average basis by school and grade as well as overall passing percentages.
3.  Spending across the 15 schools in this district was also investigated to see if there was any correlation between dollars spent and overall testing success.
4.  Elements looked at in evaluating reading and math scores included school size, dollars spent, and public versus charter schools status.
5.  Spending per student was calculated based on the number of students per school and the budget for each school.  Spending was placed into bins for easier comparisons.

## Analysis
1.  Schools that spent less than $584/student produced both the best average and overall passing percentage rates for both math and reading,
2.  A medium range bin of about $584- $529 / student gave the next best results.
3.  Spending the most dollars did not correlate to the best results suggesting the bang for the buck may be related to several factors including school size and population.
4.  As would also be expected average reading scores were higher across the schools when compared to average math scores.  Students in the USA tend to find math more challenging than reading.
